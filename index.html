                <p>Hi there, I am Thuy Duong Nguyen </p>
                <p>I'm from Vietnam but now I'm living in Melbourne, Australia. I studied Hospitality Management and graduated in 2018 with the degree of Bachelor of Hospitality Management. I have worked in the Hospitality industry for 7 years. Due to effects of COVID-19 in 2020, I had to change my carreer into the retail industry.</p>
                <p>I live to travel and explore the new country and its culture, so far I have travelled a couples of countries and would love to do more in the future. I also love watching tv show and dramas, espeacially K-drama. Same as many other girls, I also like to hangout with my friends</p>
                <p> I'm a hard working person and fast learner as well as easily adapt to new working environment</p>
